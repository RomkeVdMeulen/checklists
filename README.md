Romke's Checklists
==================

This document contains a number of checklists I've build up as a
developer. I'm making them public because I see no reason not to.
However, I offer no guarantees that they'll suit any purpose but my
own: they're provided as-is. Please don't use these as an excuse not
to work things out for yourself: it may take more effort, but it is
the only way things will work out for you in the long run.
